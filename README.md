	•	🐚 Automating security tasks and bug bounty workflows with shell scripts.
	•	📓 Writing detailed writeups for TryHackMe and Hack The Box challenges.
	•	👩‍🏫 Teaching IT & coding: Python exercises, Scratch projects, LEGO Spike Prime robotics.

## 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on:
	•	🔐 Offensive security / ethical hacking projects.
	•	🧰 Custom scripts and automation for pentesting.
	•	🌐 Web vulnerability scanning and automation.

## 💡 I’m looking for help with:
	•	🐍 Advanced Python development and clean code practices.
	•	🧪 Writing automated tests and improving code coverage.
	•	🔄 Streamlining GitHub Actions and automation workflows.

## 🌱 I’m currently learning:
	•	🕸️ Web exploitation techniques (XSS, SQLi, LFI…).
	•	📡 Networking fundamentals & packet analysis.
	•	🧠 Advanced bug bounty methodology and target recon.
	•	💻 Application development as part of my Bachelor in Computer Science.

## 💬 Ask me about:
- 🧑‍💻 TryHackMe & Hack The Box paths and writeups.
- 🛠️ Building your own tools for ethical hacking.
